## Article

How did I spend last week?

1. Every day I did laboratory work on programming technology, operating systems and computer practicum. 
2. The week passed very quickly because of the heavy load, but I coped and I don't regret anything.
3. I went to the university 3 times in a week and spent 9 hours on it
