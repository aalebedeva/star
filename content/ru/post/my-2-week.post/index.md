## Article

How did I spend last week?

last week I completed 3 labs in basic programming, 6 labs for computer practice, and 1 lab in programming technology. I got even closer acquainted with the assembler and the C ++ programming language. I am very glad that I can get a quality education at my university. I was also kicked out of the spa school because I have an unpleasant face, but I don’t get upset, because I don’t need this school to realize my potential.
