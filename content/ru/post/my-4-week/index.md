Over the past week, I've completed labs #9 and #10

I also did 3 labs in other subjects.

I went to KVN in the main building of RUDN University. I really liked it. The guys were funny and resourceful. I advise you to visit this event, you will not regret it.

I also played volleyball many times with my friends from university. It was an unforgettable experience. Playing outdoor volleyball is a separate kind of pleasure.
